    <h2>about us</h2>
    <p>Open Whisper Systems is two things: a large community of privacy advocates working to make mobile communications more secure, and a small team of dedicated developers, who maintain a best-in-class security protocol and related client software. How do you know it's safe? You can <a>audit it yourself</a>, or <a>trust the experts</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Do we work for Twitter?</strong> <em class='posi'>No</em>.<br /> <strong>Does our software cost money to use?</strong> <em class='posi'>Nope</em>. <br/><br/><em>Our mission is to make privacy simple and the best that it can be. It is also our mission to stay weird.</em></p>
