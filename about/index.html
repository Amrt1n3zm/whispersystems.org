            <h3> Our Story </h3>
            <p>At Open WhisperSystems, we’re working to both advance the state of
            the art for secure communication and also reduce the friction
            required for ordinary people to make use of it. We want everyone to
            have access to advanced secure communication methods that are as
            easy and reliable to use as making a normal phone call or sending a
            normal text message.</p>

            <p>Whisper Systems was a company focused on the development of mobile
            security software, which was acquired by Twitter in late 2011.
            Twitter very generously made some of the Whisper Systems software
            available under an Open Source license (GPLv3), which has since
            been under open development by the community. The software has seen
            a number of new releases based on that open development, and we’ve
            been calling the project for this continued work “Open Whisper Systems.”</p>

            <p>This is where we will be promoting, distributing, and coordinating
            the continued development of mobile security and privacy software.
            In an environment of increasingly pervasive surveillance, we want
            to make it as easy as possible for anyone to be able to organize
            and communicate securely. We hope you’ll join us.
