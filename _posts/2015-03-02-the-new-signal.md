Today we're releasing [Signal 2.0](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669), with
support for TextSecure private messaging.

It is now possible to send end-to-end encrypted group, text, picture, and video messages between Signal on iPhone and
TextSecure on Android, all without SMS and MMS fees. Signal 2.0 blends private phone calls and private messaging into a
single frictionless interface, allowing you to focus on what's important by quickly organizing your conversations
using an inbox/archive work flow.

### Privacy is possible, Signal makes it easy

Signal uses your existing phone number and address book. There are no separate logins, usernames, passwords, or PINs
to manage or lose.

We cannot hear your conversations or see your messages, and no one else can either. Everything in Signal
is always end-to-end encrypted, and painstakingly engineered in order to keep your communication safe.

Signal has been designed for the mobile environment from the ground up. Messages and incoming calls are fully asynchronous;
push notifications let you know when new messages have arrived, so they'll be waiting for you if the app is in the background,
your battery dies, or you temporarily lose service.

### Speak freely with integrated private calling

Make crystal-clear private phone calls to people who live across town, or across the ocean, with no long-distance charges.
