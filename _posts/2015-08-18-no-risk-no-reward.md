After immersing myself for years and years in the world of finance
(specifically, options market making and algorithmic trading), there
was no escaping this mantra of "no risk, no reward."  Most of the
time, my (trading) style was fairly risk averse.  I knew how to find
the signals of opportunities among the daily noise to reap small
rewards.  Fortunately, I also learned how to think about the outliers
and to take the occasional, big but calculated risks.

XXXXX

The risks always lie with the known unknowns and unknown unknowns.
For me, now, there are plenty of both.  A new city, new industry, new
role, new pace of life, and, most succinctly, a new leaf.  It’s scary,
but this new world offers endless possibilities.  And it was born out
of my amazing opportunity to join the Open Whisper Systems team.

Perhaps I’ve made my way onto the OWS team because of musings that life
is becoming more like Oceania in George Orwell’s [1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four).
Maybe I’ve been influenced by my daily visits to the financial blog [Zero Hedge](http://www.zerohedge.com/).
Or it could be from the realization of how much of my information is
publicly available, and much, by my own choice.  How else am I going to
be social? Or share pictures of my first-ever morning run to the Pacific
Ocean?

I took a giant leap (read: big risk) by leaving behind the blinking numbers
of my trading screen to move into the qualitative world of

Now I’m advocating for users and listening to your comments, but don’t worry
I’ll manage to bring the finance inspired quantitative data in my line of reasoning.

During my first few days I felt like a novice swimmer jumping into the deep end.
I went from playing in the shallow end of the pool as a long-time
[Signal](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669?mt=8)
user to now using multiple devices with multiple numbers to recreate and test issues.
I was learning about bloom filters, inquiring about TCP and UDP ports, and going
through all of my sources --- blogs, [github](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/),
and knowledge from my world class colleagues.

Did I say that was just for my first few days?  I meant every day.  Every hour.
Since I started.  I’m being pushed outside the bounds of my expertise by looking
at things from different perspectives and trying to hit my milestones.  I’m on
a hockey stick learning curve and I couldn’t ask for anything better.

So where does taking the leap to join OWS land on the risk/reward spectrum?
The risk was great.  The reward?  Only time will tell.  But, so far, it looks
to be even greater than I originally imagined.  Every day has been an affirmation
that I made the right move.  I am so fortunate to be in a company where they hire
already motivated people and inspire them.

It’s only been two weeks.  Check back soon!
