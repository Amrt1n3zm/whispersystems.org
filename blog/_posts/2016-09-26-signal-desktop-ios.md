The latest Signal for iPhone release now includes multi-device support, allowing you to seamlessly move your private
messaging experience from your iPhone to your desktop computer and back.  Once you've linked a desktop
client from within the Signal iPhone app, you can switch to the desktop at any time, whether your phone is online
or not.

The Signal Desktop app also supports a new iOS theme, which is enabled by default whenever you link a desktop
client from the Signal iPhone app.  Try it out!
