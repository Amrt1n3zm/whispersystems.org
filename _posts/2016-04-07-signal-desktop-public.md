For the past few months, the Signal Desktop beta has been available through an
[invitation program](/blog/signal-desktop).  We've gotten a lot of feedback,
made a lot of improvements, and are now ready to open the beta up for [public
access](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/signal-private-messenger/bikioccmkafdpakkkcpdbppfkghcmihk).

### Private messaging, with all ten fingers

We've refined the UI throughout the beta program to improve the look and feel of the app.

As always, everything is end-to-end encrypted and painstakingly engineered in order to keep your communication
safe -- allowing you to send high-quality private group, text, picture, and video messages for free.

For more information, see the [original desktop beta announcement](/blog/signal-desktop).
