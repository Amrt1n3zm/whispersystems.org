*A guest post by [meskio](http://meskio.net/).*

My cell phone used to be a black and white nokia until a couple of weeks ago, when I decided to enter in the smartphone world. 
Now that there are more mobile devices connected to internet than computers, I think it's time for me as well to discover 
the possibilities of this technology. During this few weeks I've been playing with my new toy, checking how to secure it, 
what freesoftware is around to use cryptography on it.

Someone on the irc told me there will be a hackathon of whispersystems not that far away from my place. I couldn't miss this 
opportunity to get my hands on android development and try to do something useful. So there I was in Zurich, after three 
hours of travel, sleeping on a couch that a friend of a friend has lent me, anxious to hack with the whispersystems hackers.

Colab is a great place for hackathons with great sound system (when you manage to make it work), tables with electrical 
plugs everywhere and comfortable sofas to change your place when you are tired of the table. But the most important of 
everything, they have a fridge full of drinks with club mate.

We've been 6 people on the hackathon: Christine and Frederic hacking on the iOS version of TextSecure, Desiree, Kashif and 
me learning while coding for the android version of TextSecure and Moxie trying to have something done on the server side 
while we all ask him questions.

Kashif and Desiree couldn't stay for the whole weekend, but they were full of energy and pretty productive. Kashif wrote 
some lines about the weekend:

Christine took care of the organization of the event, welcoming us, providing food and bringing us to good places for beers. 
When Frederic was not concentrated behind his screen was taking pictures of the event. And in the breaks Moxie amaze us with 
his stories.

Time past fast when you are focus on something, I have the feeling that the weekend was really short and that I didn't have 
time to accomplish much. But I have few commits merged on the main repository and I learned a lot. I'm glad I went to of the 
hackathon.
