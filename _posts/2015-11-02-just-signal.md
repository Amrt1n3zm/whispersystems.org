Today we've started rolling out [Signal for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms),
which unites simple private messaing and simple private calling into a single app on Android.
This is the culmination of our effort to combine TextSecure and RedPhone into one app, which
we [began on iPhone](/blog/the-new-signal/) and are now bringing to completion on Android.

### TextSecure is becoming Signal

Over the next few days, users with TextSecure installed will get a normal update that brings a new name.
The new version includes all the existing functionality of TextSecure, plus the ability to make and
receive private calls with other Signal users.

### RedPhone is moving to Signal

Users with RedPhone installed will be prompted to install Signal instead.  If you already
have Signal installed, you can just uninstall RedPhone. It will no longer be maintained as
an independent app.

### Privacy is possible, Signal makes it easy

As always, Signal uses your existing phone number and address book. There are no separate
logins, usernames, passwords, or PINs to manage or lose.

We cannot hear your conversations or see your messages, and no one else can either. Everything in Signal
is always end-to-end encrypted, and painstakingly engineered in order to keep your communication safe.

### View source

All of our code is free, open source, and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/WhisperSystems).  This allows experts
to verify our protocols and our implementations.

Like everything we do at Open Whisper Systems, dedicated development is supported by
[community donations](https://freedom.press/bundle/encryption-tools-journalists) and grants. Signal contains no advertisements,
and it doesn't cost anything to use. [Try it out!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms)
