          <h3>Zones</h3>

          <p>A mashup of geofencing and anti-theft security features, Zones will
          allow your phone react accordingly when crossing friendly or hostile
          borders that you define. For example, a phone inside a police station may
          wipe its call and message history, clear its contacts list, or even
          trigger a super-lock state, essentially disabling use until the device
          has returned to a trusted location.</p>
