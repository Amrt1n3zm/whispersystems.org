Today we're making the Signal Desktop beta available. Signal Desktop brings the
trusted private messaging experience of Signal to the desktop, with a simplicity
that allows you to seamlessly continue conversations back and forth between
your mobile device and your desktop computer.

### Private messaging, now with all ten fingers

As always, everything is end-to-end encrypted and painstakingly engineered in order to keep your communication
safe -- allowing you to send high-quality private group, text, picture, and video messages for free.

### Multiple devices, single identifier

Signal Desktop is a Chrome app which links with your phone, so all incoming and outgoing messages
are displayed consistently on all your devices.  Your contacts don't have to guess
where to message you, and when you switch devices the conversation you started
will already be there.

### Android devices only, for now

For the initial Signal desktop beta, only linking to Android devices is supported.
[Follow us on twitter](https://twitter.com/whispersystems) for updates on when the
iOS app supports Signal Desktop.

### View source

All of our code is free, open source, and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/WhisperSystems).  This allows experts
to verify our protocols and our implementations.

Like everything we do at Open Whisper Systems, dedicated development is supported by
[community donations](https://freedom.press/bundle/encryption-tools-journalists) and grants. Signal Desktop contains
no advertisements, and it doesn't cost anything to use.
