*A post from Natalie, Winter Break Of Code, Day Sixteen*

Today, I watched sunlight dance atop billowing waves,
a natural circus spectacular.

I meditated on two syllables,
allowing my breath and heartbeat
to synchronize,
and I too became a part of the show.

XXXXX

No longer a spectator,
I rejoiced in the form of stillness,
a stillness I can sometimes hold
and carry with me throughout the day.

These things are beautiful gifts.

Everythingâ€™s changing rapidly.
The waves seem heavier than ever.
But I am learning to surf,
and experiences like this
are giving me strength and perspective.


A butterfly lay dead on the table outside.
It was cast down by the monstrous force
of the circus
of the billowing waves dressed in sunlight,
and of course,
my heartbeat and  breath,
they were there too.
